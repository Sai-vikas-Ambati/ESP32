# ESP32 Practice Codes

This repository contains a collection of **ESP32 codes** that I practised and implemented while learning IoT and embedded programming.  
The codes cover basic functionalities such as GPIO, sensors, communication protocols, and other ESP32 features.

## 📂 Contents

- **GPIO examples** – LED blinking, multiple LED control, switch inputs.  
- **Sensor interfacing** – Reading values from basic sensors.  
- **ADC examples** – Using ESP32’s ADC to read analog inputs.  
- **PWM examples** – Controlling LED brightness or motor speed.  
- **Interrupts** – Handling external events using GPIO interrupts.  
- **Timers** – Using ESP32 timers for delays and periodic tasks.  
- **Communication**  
  - UART (Serial communication)  
  - I2C / SPI interfacing  
  - Wi-Fi basics (connecting ESP32 to a network)  
  - MQTT practice for IoT communication  

*(The above list may grow as I add more practice codes.)*

## 🛠 Notes

- These codes are meant **only for practice and learning**.  
- Tested using **ESP32 development boards** (e.g., ESP32 DevKit V1).  
- Written and uploaded using **Arduino IDE / ESP-IDF**.  
- Some codes may be minimal or experimental.
